Welcome to my web application for statistics on Anime Music Quiz (AMQ), a popular quiz game developed by Egerod.
This application is not affiliated with AMQ or Egerod, but it uses data from an improved version of the AMQ database that I maintain.

I also use ranked data collected by [blissfulyoshi](https://github.com/blissfulyoshi) for anything related to ranked.

Big thanks to Egerod and more importantly the database admins for maintaining the AMQ database and to blissfulyoshi for collecting the ranked data.

If you haven't played AMQ yet, be sure to check it out at <https://animemusicquiz.com>.
It features one of the largest and most comprehensive community-driven anime song databases and many other features that make it one of the most advanced quiz games out there.

I hope you enjoy using my web application! Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback.
